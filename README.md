# q-learning-notes
just my simple notes on reinforcement learning. I don't do much with RNNs and textual information but I plan to do lots with Q and autoML. Someone else might find these notes handy as well. Don't count on excellence though.


#### NOTES  
q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning. An agent acts inside of an environment.  
ENVIRONMENT is where the agent explores. Example includes video game world.  
AGENT is the actor which acts on or explores the environment. Example includes video game character.  
STATE is just the status of the agent, a Mario character jumping for instance, or currently in the air, location.  
REWARD is a value with some magnitude based on quality of preceeding action. The skater bot gains a higher score in THPS2 than it did   
  previously, the chess bot won in less moves or took more higher point value pieces sooner.
